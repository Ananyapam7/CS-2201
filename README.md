# CS-2201
This introductory course on computation offered to second year undergrads at IISER K encompasses the following-
- Root finding by the bisection, regula falsi and Newton-Raphson methods. 
- Study of iteration systems and solving iterative equations 
- Elementary operations of matrices; eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
- Solving ordinary differential equations by the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods. 
- Interpolation and extrapolation of data sets. 
- Random processes and probabilities. 
- Elementary simulations of physical, chemical or biological systems

These are my solutions for the same.
